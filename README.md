# 🛠️ REPAIR PILOT (Work in Progress)
### Repair Pilot is an assistance system that analyzes repair data to make your product better.
#### Workflow:

1. **Preprocessing Data**: Clean and prepare repair data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might be helpful.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Descriptive Analysis: Understand the basics of repair data.
   - Diagnostic Analysis: Clustering and Association Rule Mining.
   - Predictive Analysis: Neural Networks (Forecasting)

# 💻 To-Do List
- [ ] Solve bugs!
- [ ] Improve current data analysis methods. 
- [ ] Brainstorm more ideas for analyzing repair data.
- [ ] Ensure each script is modular to allow independent execution.
- [ ] Plot and save results in a consistent format across all types of analyses.
- [ ] Document each script with clear comments and instructions.
- [ ] Add tests

# 🎯 Future Goals
The Repair Pilot is currently limited to analyzing CSV files with a specific structure. To enhance scalability and efficiency, the following developments are envisioned:

- [ ] Automating the extraction of repair data from various database systems (e.g., SQL).
- [ ] Handling repair data in any format and structure.
- [ ] Exploring the integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance user experience by incorporating domain-specific knowledge However, does this add value?
