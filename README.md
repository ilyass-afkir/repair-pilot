# 🛠️ REPAIR PILOT (Work in Progress)
#### Repair Pilot is an assistance system that analyzes repair data to make your product better.
Here is how its works:
1. Preprocess Data
2. Feature Engineering
3. Data Analysis: Descriptive, Diagnostics and Predictiev analyses sequentially
4. Plot and save results

# ToDo
- [ ] Separate the 3 data analysis (data_analysis.py) in 3 different scripts
- [ ] Sep 

# 🎯 Future Goals
Repair Pilot can currently only analyze CSV Files containing a specific structure. Thats not scalabel and efficient!
Here is what I imagine on what to do next:

- [ ] Automating the extraction of repair data from databases (SQL etc.) 
- [ ] Ability to analyze any repair data (of any format, structure etc.)
- [ ] Integration of an LLM to improve UX and incorparte domain knowledge. (BUT, does this really make sense? Or do you want to just jump on the hype wagon?)
