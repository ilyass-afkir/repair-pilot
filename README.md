# üõ†Ô∏è REPAIR PILOT (Work in Progress)
#### Repair Pilot is an assistance system that analyzes repair data to make your product better.
Workflow Overview:

1. **Preprocessing Data**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might improve the models.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Descriptive Analysis: Explore the data to understand the basics.
   - Diagnostic Analysis: Understand the relationships between variables.
   - Predictive Analysis: Apply models to make predictions.

# üíª To-Do List

- [ ] Ensure each script is modular to allow independent execution.
- [ ] Plot and save results in a consistent format across all types of analyses.
- [ ] Document each script with clear comments and instructions for reproducibility.
- [ ] Set up a code review process to maintain coding standards.
- [ ] Add tests

# üéØ Future Goals
The Repair Pilot is currently limited to analyzing CSV files with a specific structure. To enhance scalability and efficiency, the following developments are envisioned:

- [ ] Develop a method for automating the extraction of repair data from various database systems (e.g., SQL).
- [ ] Create a universal analysis tool capable of handling repair data in any format and structure, eliminating current limitations.
- [ ] Explore the integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance the user experience by incorporating domain-specific knowledge. This could facilitate more intuitive interactions and possibly generate insights beyond structured queries. However, it's crucial to assess whether this adds tangible value or if it's merely following a trend.
