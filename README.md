# 🛠️ REPAIR PILOT
### Repair Pilot is an assistance system that analyzes repair data to make your product better.  
After preprocessing and feature engineering, the data analysis is perfirmed in 3 destinct steps: desdritpiteb, diagnostic and precitive, going from dgeneral to more in detph resutls.

# 🎯 Next Steps
Repair Pilot can currently only analyze CSV Files containing a specific structure. Thats not scalabel and efficient!
Here is what I imagine on what to do next:

- [ ] Automating the extraction of repair data from databases (SQL etc.) 
- [ ] Ability to analyze any repair data (of any format, structure etc.)
- [ ] Integration of an LLM to improve UX and incorparte domain knowledge. (BUT, does this really make sense? Or do you want to just jump on the hype wagon?)
