# How can Repair Pilot be further imporved?
Repair Pilot can currently only analyze CSV Files containing a specific structure. Thats not scalabel. Here is what I can imagine of what can do as the next steps:
1. Automatically extract data from a datbase such as SQL etc. []
2. Repair Oilot should be able to analyze any data of any format or structure (LLMs could be very helpful here).[]
3. Integrate LLMs to imporve UI and get more out of your data. []
