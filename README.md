# 🎯 How can we improve Repair Pilot?
Repair Pilot can currently only analyze CSV Files containing a specific structure. Thats not scalabel and efficient. 
Here is what I imagine on what can do in the next steps:

- [ ] Automatically extract data from a database (SQL etc.) 
- [ ] Analysis of any data of any format or structure (LLMs could be very helpful here to understand the data structure)
- [ ] Integrate LLMs to improve UX and incorparte domain knowledge. For example:
      - A first text prompt like "What are the most critical parts of my welding machine?" should trigger the respective analyzis procedures
      - A second text prompt like "What can I do now to imtove my welding machine?" should trigger domain knowledge based on the analyis results
      - ...
